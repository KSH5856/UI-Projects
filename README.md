# Mini React Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini React components built for learning and practice. Each project demonstrates a unique concept or functionality implemented using modern React (Hooks, functional components, etc.).

## 🚀 Projects Included

- 📸 Image Slider – A responsive image carousel with navigation buttons.
- 📁 Folder Structure Viewer – A collapsible file and folder tree structure component. A good example of how recursion works.

- 🎨 Random Color Generator – Click a button to generate and display random background colors.
- ⭐ Star Rating Component – Interactive star rating system with hover and click functionality.
- 📂 Accordion Component – Expandable/collapsible content sections for better UI organization.
- 🌙 Theme Changer – Toggle between dark and light themes using a global CSS variable.
- 📦 Load More Products – Fetches n products at a time and appends them on each button click while retaining previously fetched data.
